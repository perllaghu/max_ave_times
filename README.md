## Calculating times for stages, for a variety of speeds

Under MSA rules, the __bogie__ time for a stage is the time taken to traverse
that stage at an maximum average speed. Note this is an _average_ speed,
not a _maximum_ speed.

Stages usually have a __target__ time, which is the __slowest__ time a
competitor can clear a stage without being penalised.

Using this web page, you can enter the distance, and the times taken to clear
that stage at a variety of speeds will be calculated for you.

## Target Times
The target time of a stage can be calculated two ways:
* it can be a lower average speed
* it can be some multiple of the Bogie time.

This system allows you to edit the latter, and the former should be just
another row.
